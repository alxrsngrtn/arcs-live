    isolated database for tests (#1113)
    
    * add a test-only firebase with individually isolated instances
    The URL parameter `testFirebaseKey` will attach to a test firebase, with
    the value prepended to all accesses to that database (in lieu of a
    version).
    
    * test flow includes new user creation
    - current issue: only the first `describe` grouping of tests will work.
      Every `describe` creates a new database, but the browser (and hence
      the logged-in cookie) persists between `describe`s.
    
    * fix `waitUntilVisible` now actually checks for visibility (not just
      selectability)
