    Fix for run_in_repo on Windows (#3880)
    
    Replaced call to ctx.actions.run with ctx.actions.run_shell.
    
    Windows was trying to execute the script as a win32 binary, which was
    failing with the following error:
    
    ```
    Action failed to execute: java.io.IOException: ERROR: src/main/native/windows/process.cc(199): CreateProcessW("C:\temp\7qgjmpto\execroot\__main__\bazel-out\x64_windows-fastbuild\bin\particles\Tutorial\Kotlin\3_JsonStore\JsonStore_genrule.sh"): %1 is not a valid Win32 application.
    ```
    
    Advice from https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3589 is to use
    ctx.actions.run_shell instead.
