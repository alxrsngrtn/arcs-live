    Using new Kotlin-->Wasm build_defs for Example Particles (#3623)
    
    * added schema2kotlin bazel build def
    
    * nit: grammar
    
    * bazel rule to download + make available kotlin native compiler
    
    * fix: var rename
    
    * - TODO: fix kotlinc_wrapper
    - created kt binary rule
    - simplified kotlinc.BUILD
    - cleaned up repo.bzl
    
    * pointing to macos repo
    
    * cleanup defs + potential optimization
    
    * trying to manually download konan deps
    
    * messy, but got it working!
    
    * cleanup
    
    * Got libraries working!
    
    * cleanup
    
    * attempt 0: host-multi-platform
    
    * - instruct bazel to download all platform versions (windows, macos, linux), let Bazel decide which one is actually needed
    - modify the wrapper script to detect which platform was *actually* downloaded, then only use *that platform's* dependencies
    
    * force add important build file
    
    * - added sha256s
    - rm redundant file
    - fixed future bugs re: extension
    
    * cleanup
    
    * Merged with upstream; resolved minor conflicts
    
    * added entrypoints to wasm binary rule
    
    * kotlin --> wasm working with current particles
    
    * added other src, oops
    
    * manifest pointing to bazel output :)
    
    * updated -- rel paths
    
    * updates + fixes to build defs
    - rm kotlin-native (favoring kotlin_native)
    - added `entry_point` to binary definition
    - bugfix: fixed binary replacement (no more cutoff)
    
    * rm gradle build
    
    * updated README instructions
    
    * Buildifier
