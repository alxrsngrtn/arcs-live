    Move src_kt into the main repo WORKSPACE (#3835)
    
    The sources are still all in src_kt (we should probably move them one
    day). And src_kt_runtests.sh is still there, but it isn't used anymore
    for running tests on travis.
    
    Getting closer to the goal of having everything be in the root
    WORKSPACE, and being able to run `bazel test ...` on Travis to test the
    whole repo.
