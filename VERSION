    Proto work: serialization (#1109)
    
    * use _onStateData for events that can directly populate state, plump arc info through
    
    * add getUrlParam to utils to complement setUrlParam
    
    * create cloud-arc
    
    * change cloud-users to use WatchGroup instead of doing it by hand
    
    * make it easier to force a debug level
    
    * give Gomer some default coords that actually exist
    
    * plumb title add watch-group.js
    
    * try to clone at least first level
    
    * plumb first try at persistent arcs and handles via runtime storage
    
    * start building unit test infrastructure for a-s-p
    
    * simple rearrangement
    
    * more tests
    
    * simplify cloud-users
    
    * better test description
    
    * make xen-explainer actually work
    
    * a `suggestion` turns into a `plan` after instantiation, plumb basic search support
    
    * runtime literal models may sometimes contain `undefined` because of Firebase, constructed objects never should
