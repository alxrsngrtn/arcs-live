    Create new deploy script for pipes-shell on Android (#3933)
    
    This new script includes only the stuff that is strictly needed for
    running the pipes-shell (i.e. webpacked shell code, webpacked arcs
    runtime code, shell index.html), and notably does not include the entire
    particles/ directory. It is up to the client to include the manifest
    files it actually needs (via arcs_manifest/arcs_manifest_bundle rules).
