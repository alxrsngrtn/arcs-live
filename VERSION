    Simplify speculative execution logic: remove plan groups. (#1501)
    
    Experiment with removing plan grouping and instead (go back to?)
    kicking off an async task for each plan. This may be similar to what
    we did in the past which (I understand may have) caused OOM or other
    performance issues particularly on mobile devices.
    
    However, the plan grouping logic as written was confusing as the V8 VM
    doesn't actually use multiple threads for these async tasks, and, the
    grouping was inefficient since one group could finish ahead of another
    and thus tasks weren't as evenly distributed as they could have been.
    
    Before potentially doing that rework I figure we should see whether
    it's actually needed.
