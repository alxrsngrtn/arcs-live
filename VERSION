    new giftlist demo flow (#1074)
    
    Major changes are that Claire edits her own wishlist, and shares that with the purchaser, and all data is derived from the browser (rather than having checked in assets).
    
    * Introduce a new annotation particle to provide alternate shipping information for products that won't arrive in time
    * Show Claire's birthday, and an editable desired shipping date. By default dates are set so some products will make it in time, and some won't.
    * Claire (a different user) can edit her wishlist, from choices populated from current browser context via the extension.
    * Remove all local assets for the old flow.
    * Skip failing tests that need major re-work (#1077, #1078).
    
    Note that nested annotations aren't yet supported, otherwise that would be an ideal solution. See #1009.
