    Add dynamic referenceMode for PouchDbVariable (#2488)
    
    - Root cause: persistSerialization in arc.ts disables referenceMode manually
    - PouchDbVariable now stores the referenceMode in the stored variable data.
    - Adjusted tests to also test for Pouch in addition to volatile
    - Added comments on how to reproduce the issue until better testing is available.
    
    Fixes #2407
