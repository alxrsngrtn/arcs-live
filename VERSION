    Created SystemException and UserException types. (#2782)
    
    * Created SystemException and UserException types.
    
    These exceptions get propagated back to the host, and wrap the real
    exception that occurred. Orignal exception, message and stack are
    retained. Other useful info like the particle that caused it is given as
    well.
    
    * Made ReportExceptionInHost use @ByLiteral
