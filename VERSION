    solo overrides dynamic manifest (#3975)
    
    Currently connecting to host pipes-shell doesn't work at the demo app
    via the url http://localhost:8786/...?solo=<manifest> since the dynamic
    manifest via bus.dispatcher.configure always overrides the solo argument
    but the demo_manifest_bundle.arcs is not generated during web depolyment
    via the deploy.sh script.
    
    Let the solo argument override dynamic manifest provides the flexibility
    of exercising new features before bundling and deploying them via dynamic
    manifest in app assets.
