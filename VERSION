    Remove all artifacts from reducethislist (#2646)
    
    These are all imported directly from the src directory anyway, so they never
    needed to be linked in the first place.
    
    This is a significant reduction in the list.
    
    Note that the artifacts themselves should still be moved out of runtime, but
    that is for another PR.
