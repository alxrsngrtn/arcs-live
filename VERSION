    Wasm Compilation + Hot Code Reloading (#3627)
    
    * add iml to gitignore
    
    * Cleaned up wasm sdk
    
    * Created Native/Wasm example
    
    * Cleaned up build files
    
    * Using Schema gen rules instead of checked in entities
    
    * Ran buildifier
    
    * no need for binary in build file
    
    * Merged WasmTemplate and Native/Wasm
    - WasmTemplate build had an error. I replicated the project in Native/Wasm to the point where it produces the same error.
    
    * updated README
    
    * pointing to wasm sources
