    Start the process of moving to eslint based tyepscript linting (#3015)
    
    - Move main eslint config to config/eslintrc.json
    - Convert js to json to help catch syntax errors
    - Whitelist spacing and a few other minor issues.
    - Adjust sigh to pass typescript files (and ignore gen/ directories)
    - Fix sigh to check for directories explicitly
    - bump lint package versions
