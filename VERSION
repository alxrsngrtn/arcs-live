    HotCodeReload: Support for WASM particles (#3458)
    
    - Changed the reload function in PEC to accept a list of particles to reload instead of just a single particle
    - Made the file watcher less responsive to change for wasm files (so it can wait for builds of wasm file to finish
    first before reloading)
