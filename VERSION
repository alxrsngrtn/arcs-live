    Bazel arcs_cc_schema rule for generating C++ headers from .arcs schemas (#3514)
    
    * Created a bazel arcs_cc_schema rule for generating C++ header files from
    .arcs schema files.
    
    This works by running the sigh schema2pkg command in the repository root
    directory, and writing the results into the expected bazel-out folder.
    
    Other sigh commands can be trivially wrapped in the same way.
    
    * Missing build file
    
    * Switched to use expand_template() instead of write()
    
    * Fixed header guard
