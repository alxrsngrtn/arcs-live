    Verb substitution slot constraints (#1071)
    
    1) Allow particles specified by verbs to hold slot constraints. For example:
    
    ```recipe
      particle can doTheThing
        consume bar
          provide foo
    ```
    
    This means that a particle or recipe can only substitute into doTheThing if it consumes a bar slot and provides a foo slot.
    
    2) Make match-recipe-by-verb obey these constraints. Note that match-particle-by-verb doesn't, yet.
    
    3) Ensure that in at least some cases slot connections made with these constraints persist after recipe substitution. For example:
    
    ```recipe
      particle can doTheThing
        consume foo as s1
          provide bar as s2
      P
        consume master
          provide foo as s1
      Q
        consume bar as s2
    ```
    
    Will result in the matched `foo` in the recipe selected to replace doTheThing consuming `P`'s `foo`, and the matched `bar` providing a slot for `Q`'s `bar`.
    
    This almost certainly doesn't yet work in all circumstances, for example I haven't tested what happens when the slot is shared across multiple consumers.
    
    At some point we're going to want to do the same thing as this for handles, too.
