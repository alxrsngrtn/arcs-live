    Create UnifiedActiveStore interface (#3699)
    
    * Create UnifiedActiveStore interface
    
    There are now two main "Unified" classes/interfaces:
    1. UnifiedStore: contains information about a store, can be "activated"
    into a...
    2. UnifiedActiveStore: a store which has been connected to storage. Each
    active store remembers its "base store", i.e. the UnifiedStore from
    which is was activated.
    
    In the new world, UnifiedStore == Store, UnifiedActiveStore ==
    ActiveStore.
    
    It's always possible to go back to the UnifiedStore instance (which
    contains most of the interesting properties like name, id, type, etc.).
    Activating a store more than once should produce the same instance
    again.
    
    In the old world, StorageProviderBase acts as both a UnifiedStore and a
    UnifiedActiveStore. Throughout the codebase, we interchange between
    active/inactive stores at will, so cleaning this up is going to be
    interesting...
    
    There are some properties on UnifiedStore that should be on
    UnifiedActiveStore, and there are a bunch of duplicates in
    UnifiedActiveStore that should be deleted.
    
    * Fix promise handling
