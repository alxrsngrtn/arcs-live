    More tests for connecting to localNames in constraints (#1411)
    
    I also needed to convert the handles component of Shape to a map, because we're storing actual handles as the key sometimes, rather than strings.
    
    The main thing that this does is ensure that connection matches and particle matches fail if there's a specified localName for the handle in the shape and it doesn't match what the recipe version's connected to.
