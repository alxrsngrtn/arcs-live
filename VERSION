    Fix android demo app, configure shell (#3935)
    
    The shell-android API was modified in #3925 to require sending a 'configure'
    message after receiving the 'ready' message. This PR adds that, and
    mostly restores functionality in the demo app.
    
    Also updates the demo app to use the generated root manifest
    demo_manifest_bundle.arcs, and fixes the generation script (semicolons
    caused it to break).
