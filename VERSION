    Fix for Kotlin generated schemas (#3825)
    
    For a file Foo.arcs, the generated code used to be output to Foo.kt. However, this could easily cause conflicts with an existing source file Foo.kt. Now, we instead call it Foo_GeneratedSchemas.kt, which no self-respecting developer would ever use. This should avoid conflicts.
    
    Developers won't actually see this; they will still consume the generated code via the build rule's name, e.g. ":foo_schema".
