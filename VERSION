    Improve continuous integration and docker build performance (#2175)
    
    - Use npm ci instead of npm install so we get reproducable builds from package-lock.json
    - Explicitly install node_modules using npm ci as the first step in the Docker build.
      This allows for that step to be cached leading to much, much faster builds.
    - Introduce cloudbuild.yaml that enables cached builds and tags 'latest'
