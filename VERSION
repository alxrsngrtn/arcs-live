    * Improve type handling in loading and particle execution
    - Add documention to Loader to help describe the steps taken.
    - Add types for load/require Particle, adjust callers and tests
    - Add types to slot-dom-consumer, particle-execution-context etc.
    - Identified a problematic issue with readonly properties.
    - Removed capabilities from the Particle constructor and added a write-once method to set them.
