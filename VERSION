    pipes-shell-2: performance improvements (#3226)
    
    * disable speculative execution, but support resolved handles in descriptions
    
    * s/weasel.dev/unknown ... hope the former wasn't load-bearing
    
    * match autofill using type instead of source
    
    * minor buff-up for Utils.resolve
    
    * implement autofill without planner
    
    * allow planner to exist without specex, and support descriptions on resolved handles
    
    * no-planner autofill
    
    * plumb a 'caption' message-verb
    
    * fix smoke-test timing
    
    * remove dead code
    
    * promote ready signaling to pipe.js, it's platform agnostic
    
    * add the list of loaded recipes to the `ready` message
