    Handle References in the dataflow analyser. (#3442)
    
    Logic for dealing with references is described in go/arcs-dataflow-references. We can prune some of the inputs when the output is a reference. We accomplish this by reusing the "derives from" machinery to represent the input edges that didn't get pruned.
