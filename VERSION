    Better event handling in StorageProxy tests (#1562)
    
    * Better event handling in StorageProxy tests
    
    Events are now triggered directly by the backing stores (no need to use
    engine.sendUpdate), with an option to block them for specific write ops.
    
    * Inverted flag for events on test stores, fixed styling.
