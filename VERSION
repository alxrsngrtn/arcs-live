    ALDS should be off by default for the demo app (#3769)
    
    With default on, the demo app would wait until the Arcs Explorer
    at the host connects to the ALDS since the Arcs runtime at the
    device blocks waiting for the ready signal of the Arcs Explorer
    at its initialization path by design of explore-proxy parameter.
    
    The android property "debug.arcs.runtime.use_alds" has been ready
    in place to switch the ALDS proxy dynamically, so we can deem
    ALDS on/off as an option as of now.
