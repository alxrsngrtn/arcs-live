    Move all planning and strategizing files under src/planning (#2655)
    
    * Move all planning and strategizing files under src/planning
    
    Much cheese is once again in motion!
    
    All tests pass, though note that there are still dependencies on src/planning
    in runtime/tests and runtime/testing. These will be refactored out in a
    subsequent PR, corresponding to a subsequent step in the work plan.
    
    * Fixed missing file that needed changing
