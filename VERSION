    Add wasm particle API tests; currently C++ only (#3453)
    
    * Add wasm particle API tests; currently C++ only
    
    - only executed when invoked via 'sigh wasmTest'; more work required to merge into the standard 'test'
    - removes the somewhat magic 'linkManifest' option in wasm.json; tests just use explicit file paths
    - adds RozSlotComposer to simply record renderSlot calls for after-the-fact verification
    - sets up more versatile Loader.clone() so tests can make custom Loaders more easily
    - some API tweaks inside the C++ particle code
    
    * Review updates
