    Make tsc dramatically faster. (#1757)
    
    * typescriptify crdt-collection-model.
    
    This uncovered an issue with our custom-loader, which was treating
    import statements without a '.js' specifier as cjs imports.
    
    * Start moving things around
    
    * Only compile the typeScript files
    
    * Fix all the other bits.
