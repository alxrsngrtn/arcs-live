    Pouchdb Implementation Revamp (#2921)
    
    * Introduce a revamped PouchDB implementation that is largely state-free
    
    - Adds a generic Upsert function that abstracts the read-modify-write cycle for Pouch
    - Revamps Arc tests to perform most in PouchDB, skip ones that don't
    - Add more minor cleanups and tidiness.
