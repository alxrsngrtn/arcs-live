    Adds syntax support for datastore claims. (#3281)
    
    Syntax only, analyser in a follow up PR.
    
    I was able to reuse some of the existing Claim classes, but had to add
    new AST nodes for datastore claims, because the syntax is slightly
    different (there's no handle name, and "derives from" is not supported).
