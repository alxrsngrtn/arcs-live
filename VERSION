    Added ArcsServiceBridge to Arcs Java API. (#3572)
    
    * Added ArcsServiceBridge to Arcs Java API.
    
    This class implements the ArcsEnvironment interface, except instead of
    talking to JS it talks to the IArcsService. It's not actually hooked up
    to anything yet. We're going to add Particle code to use the Bridge.
    
    I've added a android.client package; this is intended to be for all the
    code which lives in "client" particles, i.e. clients of the ArcsService,
    i.e. particles which live in a different service.
    
    I'm planning to create a similar android.host package, which is going
    to be for code that lives on the ArcsService-side which needs to
    communicate with the clients.
    
    The ArcsServiceStarter interface is the mechanism by which Arcs code is
    able to start up the ArcsService (the latter lives inside the app; only
    it is able to correctly create the explicit intent needed to start the service).
