    UnifiedStore refactor: StoreInfo object, toManifestString() (#3746)
    
    * UnifiedStore refactor: StoreInfo object, toManifestString()
    
    Made a few changes to UnifiedStore and its subclasses:
    
    1. StorageStub.toString() became UnifiedStore.toManifestString():
      * toString() shouldn't take arguments, but this one needs to have one
      * StorageProviderBase had a different, unused, implementation of
        toString(). Deleted.
      * Moving it to UnifiedStore means we don't need to duplicate the logic
        over in the new Store class.
    
    2. Added missing properties to UnifiedStore, to make toManifestString()
    work. It needed things like claims, originalId, etc.
    
    3. Moved all of the "information about the store" properties into a new
    StoreInfo type. This makes it easier to share and copy store properties
    around.
    
    * Added TODO
    
    * Fixed ManifestPatch...
