    Inject devtools endpoints into Arc constructor and deserialize method (#2671)
    
    * Refactor how the runtime sets up devtools endpoints.
    
    This breaks the runtime debugging dependency on planning. (Tests still need to be done.)
    
    * Patched per review comments
    
    * Add a todo to replace map with foreach at some point.
