    E2e dummy autofill (#3594)
    
    * Added dummy Java and JS code for an AutofillParticle example.
    
    It doesn't work yet. The particle is not hooked up to anything. It needs to be attached to the RemotePec, its handles need to be initialized, and we need to actually run the arc.
    
    * e2e simple autofill prototype (based on #3592)
    
    * Update ArcsService to provide `startArc` method
    
    * map recent-people store into demo recipe to suggest from
    
    * address comments
