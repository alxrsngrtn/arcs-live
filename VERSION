    Optimize Description Calculation (#2905)
    
    - In Slot Composer only calculate the Descriptions once per Arc.  This reduces storage calls by about 10x on the restaurant list.
    - Add many more Typescript types.
    - Refactor Description
      - add private
      - remove this usage for static methods
      - move non-async init code to constructor.
      - readability and docs.
