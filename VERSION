    Added an OrderedSet class. (#3385)
    
    * Added an OrderedSet class.
    
    Hooks it up in the Flow/FlowModifier to use for edgeIds. This will be
    needed in order to resurrect the full path of edges (in order) from the
    Flow, so we can report sensible failure messages.
    
    * Reverted ordering of edgeIds in toUniqueString() methods.
    
    This was breaking the deduping of equivalent cycle traversals, and
    exploding the search space.
