    Track originating particle for mutations from pec (#1567)
    
    * Track originating particle for mutations from pec
    
    All mutation messages from PEC thread the originating particle ID. This
    is echoed back in any events generated by storage.
    
    Before delivery to the particle, the originator is converted to a boolean
    flag.
    
    * Spilt originator and originatorId
