    Fix bug in //:all_srcs glob (#3856)
    
    Globs can only reach into subdirectories when those subdirectories do
    not contain a BUILD file of their own.
    
    The :all_srcs filegroup was designed to copy over all of the important
    src files into bazel runfiles so that things like `sigh build` can work.
    However, there are some folder (notably the tools folders) that include
    BUILD files, so those sources weren't being copied.
    
    I've added deps for //src/tools and //tools so those now get included.
    
    There are other folders that have BUILD files (e.g. //src/wasm) which
    are still not being included, but I don't think that's an issue (for
    now).
    
    This isn't an ideal situation; I think we're going to continue to be
    bitten by this as we continue to add more BUILD files. Having a proper
    bazel-driven compilation for our TypeScript code would solve a lot of
    problems...
