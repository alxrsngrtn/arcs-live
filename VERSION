    ConCap: test tutility to capture or silence console logging. (#4086)
    
    Some tests result in console output as a normal result of the test case
    (usually due to error logging). This tends to obfuscate the output of
    the test execution, and sometimes hides genuine problems because we end
    up ignoring them amidst the noise. The ConCap class provides a simple
    mechanism for disabling console output completely, or capturing it to
    verify that specific messages were logged.
