    First step in plumbing BigCollections through to the PEC. (#1881)
    
    Initiating a streamed read creates a Cursor object on the host side that
    is mirrored inside the PEC, but the API calls for reading the stream are
    mediated via the BigCollection/Handle pair and the Cursor itself is
    tracked by the BigCollection instance. This is to avoid using the API
    channel "Thing" tracking, which never releases objects once mapped.
