    Strategizer Selected Pipe Processing (#2466)
    
    * experiment with pluggable pipe handlers
    
    * go full speculator
    
    * almost works
    
    * touchups
    
    * use `pipes` slot to pass not-root test
    
    * Don't mess up test expectation
    
    * better naming
    
    * plumb in dynamic description
    
    * playing around with descriptions
    
    * only produce description if descriptions handle has been attached
    
    * more experiments
    
    * two-stage dynamic pipe routing
    
    * arc spawning maintenance
    
    * better log
    
    * restore coalsescer
    
    * clean up
    
    * remove parens
    
    * make shouldRender false for null show to prevent relevance
    
    * clean up imports
    
    * simplify syntax
    
    * update test
    
    * refactor particles to avoid suggesting random stuff for 'content' slot
    
    * rearrange so we can require 'show' handle be associated with 'content' slot
    
    * use tags for recipe matching instead of SE (thanks @shans)
    
    * #pipe_<type> not #piped_<type>
    
    * buy some time for planning
    
    * update inline docs (comment)
