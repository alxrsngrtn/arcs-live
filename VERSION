    Big BUILD rule cleanup (#3829)
    
    * Split up build_defs.bzl into multiple files.
    
    * Cleaned up Kotlin build rules a lot.
    
    * Deleted the Android stuff. It was unused, and the existing design was incompatible with how we're expecting particles to be designed.
    * Renamed all of the kotlin wasm rule names to no longer use the _wasm suffix. It's not needed, and was adding a lot of extra work all over the place to convert target names.
    * Removed arcs_manifest rule. We need to use the name for something else (bundling manifests), and it didn't do anything.
    * Removed unnecessary _lib targets for all the particles. They didn't do anything; we can just generate binaries directly.
    
    * Ran buildifier on everything
    
    * Make arcs_kt_schema accept multiple srcs
    
    * Rename arcs_kt_particle to arcs_kt_binary
    
    * Moved new .bzl files into internal/ subdir
