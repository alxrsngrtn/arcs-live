    make testing for a consistent state through a reload more stable (#1207)
    
    Part of #1189
    - Disable testing for a consistent list of suggestions until #697 is
      done.
    - Fix how we were retrieving the title for verification (we were
      comparing the entire element, including the id, not just the title).
