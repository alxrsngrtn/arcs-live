    Adds `external` keyword to particle defn syntax (#3947)
    
    * Adds `external` keyword to particle defn syntax
    
    This indicates that the particle is not instantiable, and does not have an impl file. Used for Android particles.
    
    Formerly we would say:
    ```
    particle Foo in 'path/to/nowhere.java'
    ```
    and it would magically work because it ends with .java (the file doesn't even have to exist).
    
    Now we can say:
    ```
    external particle Foo
    ```
