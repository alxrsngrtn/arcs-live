    Wasm C++: fix entity id handling and add "internal" unit tests (#3518)
    
    - Since new entities don't have an Arcs id, the various equality
    operators and the hash function need to look at all fields (op== was
    originally only looking at internal_id).
    
    - Added a crude unit test framework for checking the internal C++ code;
    starting with the generated entity classes.
    
    - Fixed a few compiler warnings as well.
