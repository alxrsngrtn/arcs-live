    Minor Shell Changes (#1818)
    
    * use only in-Arc Person's for location fetching (avoid 'find ... near Claire')
    
    * move couchdb-test to /workbench
    
    * `oncearc` workbench app creates a specific type of arc (no shell)
    
    * forcing person-in-Arc breaks demo test, undo for now
    
    * give 'Claire' a location, so she works in Restaurant tests
