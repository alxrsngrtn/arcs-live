    Last-writer-wins scheme for in-memory variables (#1585)
    
    * Last-writer-wins scheme for in-memory variables
    
    * updates storage-proxy to allow writes to variables to take place
      synchronously without a roundtrip via storage
    * uses a barrier scheme to suppress concurrent (but losing) writes
