    handleForTest helper methods (#3748)
    
    * handleForTest helper methods
    
    These new helper methods creates handles of the given type
    (singleton/collection), and use Flags.useNewStorageStack to decide which
    handle class to use.
    
    I've migrated two unit tests to use the new helper methods so you can
    see how they are used in practice. There's lots more tests that need to
    be migrated...
    
    * Resolved TODO
