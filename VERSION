    PouchDb support for Arcs Storage (#1972)
    
    * PouchDb support for Arcs Storage
    
    - Introduces pouchdb-adapter-memory at v7.0.0
    - Add a new manual test as pouch-db-tests.js
    - exports Model from CrdtCollectionModel, adds more detail on error messages
    - PouchDbStorage manages mapping from PouchDbKeys to actual database instances and replication.
    - PouchDbStorageProvider mimics the inmemory and firebase version of the same class.
    - PouchDbCollection supports reference mode and maintains a CrdtCollectionModel in Pouch.
    - PouchDbVariable introduces and maintains a new VariableStorage interface based on the _stored variable.
    - PouchDbBigCollection is unimplemented.
    - Adds some docs to StorageProviderBase
    - Adds PouchDbStorage support to StorageProviderFactory
    - Document shell query parameters to some extent.
    - Adds a build:typedoc target to help visualize datastructures
    
    There are still ~29 TODOs in the code, and more to do.  You can test this manually
    by adding a storage and torageKeyBase query param. Here's an example of using indexeddb:
    
       http://localhost:8080/shell/apps/web/index.html?storage=1&storageKeyBase=pouchdb://local/mydb
    
    And here's an example of using a remote server (which you can setup by following the instructions in server/README.md)
    
       http://localhost:8080/shell/apps/web/index.html?storage=1&storageKeyBase=pouchdb://local/mydb
    
    Addresses #1946
