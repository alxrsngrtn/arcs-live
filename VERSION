    GitHub VR (#1140)
    
    * start counting at 1 instead of 0 to avoid subid=0
    
    * fix avatars when posting mustaches
    
    * changing the description broke vr
    
    * in progress, texts not reliably appearing yet
    
    * fps: 5 captures changes, but that's a hack. reverted chat to a-text for now.
    
    * fps=1 instead of fps=0.2 seems saner
