    Simplify dataflow algorithm, so only nodes can evaluate checks. (#3177)
    
    * Simplify dataflow algorithm, so only nodes can evaluate checks.
    
    Edges can no longer evaluate checks, only nodes. This means we don't
    need the CheckEvaluator interface anymore, and simplifies BackwardsPath
    a lot, since we don't need the open/closed edge distinction.
    
    I've kept the KeepGoing/checkNext idea though, because it'll be useful
    later when we start allowing nodes to manipulate the DFS search (e.g.
    "derives from" claims).
