    Add KeyManagement to rollup (#2231)
    
    * Add KeyManagement to rollup
    
    * Add a Web ESM rollup config for frontend apps (e.g. provisioning app)
    
    Polymer 3.0 only understands ESM modules, so we need to rollup a
    bundled output that has all CJS dependencies bundled inside, except
    it should not contain any non-web dependencies (e.g. node APIs).
    
    To do this, we use the Typescript plugin to compile direct from TS,
    export .d.ts files, and and use the commonjs() resolver plugin.
    
    We still face the problem that the Polymer-CLI build tools won't
    pick up the 'browser' dependency in package.json, so that you must
    directly import 'dist/indexweb.esm.js' for now.
    
    * add declaration:true to rollup
    
    * server now picks up "main" and polymer picks up "module" in package.json
    
    * Adds webmain.ts, entrypoint for shared code (keymgmt)
    
    * fix trailing comma
