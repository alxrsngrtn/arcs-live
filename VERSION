    Added a DeepSet implementation (#3334)
    
    This is like a regular Set, except instead of using pointer equality to
    determine whether elements are in the set, it uses value equality. Value
    equality is implemented via a toUniqueString() hack, for
    simplicity/efficiency. Every element in the set has a unique string
    representation, and the string representation is used to determine
    whether other elements are duplicates.
    
    Also adds some new methods to Flow and FlowModifier, and adds FlowSet
    and FlowModifierSet using DeepSet.
