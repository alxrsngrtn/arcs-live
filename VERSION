    Rework the Entity interface (#3195)
    
    * Rework the Entity interface.
    
    Currently any fields or methods defined on Entity (like 'id' or
    'identify') will clash with fields of the same name in a schema. To fix
    this, we'll "hide" all such internal fields using a Symbol key, so only
    schema-based fields are ever directly set on the Entity object itself.
    
    This complicates access to the internals. Entity now provides static
    accessors to them, and Particle has a small number of helpers around
    those. I've left a few trap getters to try and catch incorrect uses of
    id, rawData and dataClone - these will be removed fairly soon.
