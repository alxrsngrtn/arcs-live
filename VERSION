    Allow node modules to be loaded using non-filesystem paths from non-node-modules (#1781)
    
    Currently the module loader allows an import like
    
    import {Foo} from 'Bar'
    
    If 'Bar' lives in the node_modules directory and the file that is referencing
    it is also located in the node_modules directory, otherwise an error is thrown.
    
    This change allows node_modules to be loaded without filesystem paths from
    any module.
