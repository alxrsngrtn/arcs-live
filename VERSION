    More test pipes [PR only to see Travis output] (#2238)
    
    * increase timeout, report timeout period on failure, wait for some notion of app load
    
    * use new test utils, implement pipes tests
    
    * fix timeout reporting
    
    * force location fallback to ensure there are valid geocoords in the user
    
    * move geo watch to didMount (can't access state in getInitialState)
    
    * logging should be disabled by default
    
    * remove disabled require
