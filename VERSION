    Split monolithic Type class into multiple classes. (#2289)
    
    This is a first step which mostly doesn't change the API, with the
    following exceptions:
    - TupleFields, Type.hasVariableReference, Type.isVariableReference and
      Relation.typeFor have been removed (they're either undefined or unused)
    - referenceReferredType has been renamed to referredType
    
    Next steps will be to replace the is<Type> with instanceof checks,
    replace Type.data with type-specific fields and fix the naming.
