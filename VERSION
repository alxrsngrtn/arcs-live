    Refactor StorageProviderBase.on() and .off() (#3697)
    
    * Refactor StorageProviderBase.on() and .off()
    
    These methods now have the same API as the new storage stack's on and
    off methods. The old behaviour is preserved in legacyOn and legacyOff
    methods (there's a bunch of tests that rely on that old behaviour, but
    they are all specific to the old storage stack and so will be deleted
    later).
    
    * Review comments
