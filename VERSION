    Initial simple particle to display a single game Stats record.
    
    This is likely just a temporary placeholder to simplify our lives
    while we wire up the muxing and polymorphic bits. We plan to shift to
    a particle that renders the full board, potentially with full
    interactivity, perhaps via GamePane itself, or a tweaked variant
    thereof.
