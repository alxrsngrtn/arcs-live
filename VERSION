    Improve PouchDB implementation for replication and APIs (#2015)
    
    - Handle replication events for Variables, fire events so UI refreshes
    - Eliminate double-fetches for replication events
    - Add TODOs for Collection based replication
    - Properly implement connect -- return null for keys that do not exist.
    - Introduce ValueStorage/VariableStorage to define explicit types for storing Variables.
