    Create `storage` package and the VolatileDriver. (#3857)
    
    * Adds:
      * `Driver`, `DriverProvider` interfaces
      * `DriverFactory` implementation.
      * `StorageKey` abstract class.
      * `StorageKeyParser` singleton (with tests)
      * `VolatileDriver` and associated other Volatile-related stuff.
      * A bunch of stubs.
    * Introduces some extra logic to translate the JVM maven dependencies to JS maven dependencies.
    * Had to disable js-simultaneous builds for now (due to a bug in bazel's kotlin rules)
