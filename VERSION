    Serviceworker (#1469)
    
    * Simple service worker, set up to flush cache on reload
    
    * nicer way of testing for 'nosw' parameter, which skips service worker installation
    
    * actually uninstall serviceworker with 'nosw'
    
    * simplify flushing: fetching the shell clears the cache
