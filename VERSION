    Slandles part 1: parsing (#1584)
    
    This is the first patch towards unification of slots and handles.
    
    Until this effort is completed, slots that are implemented as handles will be parsed via a
    secondary pathway that uses backticks before each production (`slot, `consume, `provide, etc). Duplicates of relevant tests will be created, tagged with 'SLANDLES'.
    
    Once the unification is complete and all tests pass both via the old slot code and via the new unified pathway, then I'll remove these duplicate tests, delete the slot code, and remove the backticks from parsing.
