    Refactors the ParticleClaimStatement AST node. (#3280)
    
    * Refactors the ParticleClaimStatement AST node.
    
    This pulls out an Expression field, similar to what we did for Checks.
    This makes the code reusable for datastore claims (since they don't have handles), and will be useful for building boolean expressions in claims.
    
    * Store ClaimExpression on edges instead of Claims
    
    The Claim.handle field is irrelevant for edges, only the expression
    actually matters. Also this will be needed for datastore claims, which don't
    have a handle name, but will need to put claims on edges.
    
    * Review comments
