    1) Add a strategy that resolves handles when there's only one choice.
    2) Stop view mapper strategies from resolving when there's only one choice.
    3) Add some very simple metrics to the strategy explorer.
    
    Splitting just view resolution like this (deterministic vs. non-deterministic) reduces
    the total number of generated recipes (on current front-end environment) from 190 to 108.
    Most savings are early on in the generation.
