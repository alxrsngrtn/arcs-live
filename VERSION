    Removes dataflow tag clobbering. (#3224)
    
    Instead of tags clobbering other tags made upstream, instead they will
    coexist peacefully together. If you want to remove an earlier tag,
    you'll need to make a specific claim about it ("claim x is not foo"),
    which we'll add support for later on.
    
    Also rejiggered the error messages slightly, because the existing ones
    don't scale for more complex boolean expressions.
