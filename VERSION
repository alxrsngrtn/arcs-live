    naming fixes: use collection, store, handle appropriate (and get rid of views) (#1389)
    
    * rename SetView to Collection (and some more view->handle renames)
    * delete unused manifest-view
    * remove deprecated "view" from manifest-parser.peg
    * Consistently use "store" and "handle" in arc and manifest classes and their apis.
