    Update c8 to latest 4.1.5 release (#3063)
    
    * Update c8 to latest 4.1.5 release
    
    - Update transitive deps to latest since c8 pulls them in anyway
    - Tested health --coverage works as expected.
    
    Note new release: includes tests for experimental modules and should be more accurate.
