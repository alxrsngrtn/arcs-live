    Fixes bug when computing 'derives from' edges. (#3377)
    
    The bug arises when processing a claim like 'claim foo derives from
    bar'. If the edge 'bar' has not been created yet, then we can't store it
    in the derivesFrom list for the edge 'foo' (and instead store
    undefined).
    
    Now, we compute the derivesFrom list in a separate pass after all edges
    have been constructed.
