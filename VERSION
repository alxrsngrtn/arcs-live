    Fix: _syncHandle sometimes causing NPEs in Kotlin / Wasm code (#3900)
    
    * passing in js null instead of 0
    
    * _syncHandle: defensive against NPEs
    
    * treating out-of-bounds memory error
    
    * using 0 over null
    
    * Don't sync handles if there's no encoding
    
    * properly handle nullable syncs and updates
    
    * fix collections issue: too many iterations
