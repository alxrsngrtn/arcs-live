    Dependent connections (#1247)
    
    - allow dependent connections to be parsed
    - inflate dependent connections & track parents
    - ensure dependent connections can be literalized correctly
    - make recipes with satisfied connections that have unsatisfied parents unresolved.
    - fix some new recipes to match new recipe syntax
