    give appveyor builds a clean way to run all non-web tests (#1206)
    
    Given the flakiness we've seen (currently tracked in #1189), I'm not
    sure that we're anywhere close to being ready to run the selenium tests
    in more than a single autobuild, nor am I sure there's any benefit to
    doing so. We can revisit later.
    
    Instead, this puts in place a cleaner system that appveyor can use to
    run only the non-web tests. This will fix #985.
