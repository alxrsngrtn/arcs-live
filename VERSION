    Adds native watch support for typescript, webpack and rollup (#2438)
    
    - Migrates webpack config into it's own file for ease of use. 2x speedup!
    - Adds npm targets for build:{step} and watch:{step}
    - Adds a top-level npm target that runs all watch items together
    - Introduces concurrently to do useful things in parallel
