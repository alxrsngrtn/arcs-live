    Allow reference-mode stores to round-trip through serialization (#4058)
    
    * Allow reference-mode stores to round-trip through serialization.
    - VolatileStorageKeys now have a unique and a localPath component
    - backing stores make use of a localPath
    - localPaths are multiplexed into a single resource during serialization/deserialization
    - reference-mode stores add stores for components during arc construction
    
    * remove some console statements and an empty line
