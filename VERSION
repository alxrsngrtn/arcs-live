    Notify ALDS upon app disconnection (#3761)
    
    Currently the disconnection can be noticed by ALDS only when the app
    is killed. The in-app disconnection would only unbind and destroy
    the Arcs service implies the web content/context at the native engine is still
    breathing there. The stale web content/context needs to be cleaned up bundling
    with the service death.
