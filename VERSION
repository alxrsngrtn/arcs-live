    small fixes for documentation (#1092)
    
    - the runtime path was incorrect (it was still referencing a separate
      arcs repo)
    - the toCamelCase method was transforming 'foo-bar' -> 'foo bar',
      instead of 'foo-bar' -> 'FooBar'. The spaces weren't supported
      elsewhere (sometimes we used an escaped `%20`, but not always), so the
      getting started page wasn't loaded.
