    Added more comprehensive unit tests for dataflow algorithm (#3341)
    
    * Added more comprehensive unit tests for HM dataflow algorithm
    
    These unit tests are for the individual steps of the algorithm (testing
    Solver methods and EdgeExpression methods directly). We already have a
    comprehensive suite of tests for full recipes.
    
    Made some slight adjustments to the API to make it easier to test.
    
    * Review comments
    
    * Fix test
