    Trim and move test-util.ts up to src/testing level. (#4073)
    
    - Tests outside of src/runtime use it, so it shouldn't be under runtime.
    - ResultInspector is only used by particle-api-test.ts; put it back there.
    - assertSingletonWillChangeTo and assertSingletonIs provide very little utility and actually make some testing worse (e.g. null checking); remove them.
    - Also fixed a bunch of floating assertThrowsAsync promises.
