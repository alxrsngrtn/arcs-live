    Added RamDisk storage to storageNG. (#3449)
    
    VolatileDriver now takes a memory argument, which tells it where to
    write to.
    
    The existing Volatile driver was actually using storage scoped to the
    whole Arcs Runtime (i.e. it was actually RamDisk storage). I pulled that
    out into its own thing (RamDiskStorageKey/RamDiskStorageDriverProvider).
    It uses VolatileDriver to do all its dirty work.
    
    Modified VolatileStorageKey/VolatileStorageDriverProvider to operate on
    a single Arc, and gave each Arc instance its own volatile memory
    instance.
    
    Now Volatile storage is correctly scoped to a running Arc, and RamDisk
    storage is scoped to the Arcs Runtime.
