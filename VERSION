    Example TensorFlow service (#3000)
    
    * begin services work
    
    * flesh out services impl
    
    * `service` method moved to Particle class
    
    * move `waltbird` into repo as particle asset
    
    * enable shorthand service invocation
    
    * do a fandango to appease lint
    
    * wip
    
    * dead module
    
    * a TensorFlowJS service and a particle to exercise it
    
    * rename ServiceTest to Ml5, create new simpler ServiceTest
    
    * increase granularity
    
    * extract common base-class for platform loaders, add `$here` alias for use in workers, remove dumb/simpleCache
    
    * we need `unsafe-eval` for tsjs anyway, so restore it and ml5 unpkg affordance
    
    * restore ml5 service
    
    * fix dangling slash on init path
    
    * cleanups
    
    * buff out Tfjs service with example abstractions
    
    * clarify comment
    
    * undo unnecessary change to firebase-storage
    
    * missing semi!
    
    * s/let/const
