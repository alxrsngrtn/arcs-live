    Promote arc-serialization-persistence logic to master behind `serial` url param (#1441)
    
    * make serialization vs steps configurable via url param (`noserial` enables old step storage/replay) (#1420)
    
    * experimental fix for arc.idle re-entrancy
    
    * logging tweaks
    
    * tweak checks order in handle.isResolved (#1419)
    
    * tweak checks order in handle.isResolved
    
    * accumulate error messages in handle.isResolved
    
    * fix recipe slot tags serialization (#1426)
    
    * More shell tweaks (#1423)
    
    * try alternate rule for focusing search input
    
    * don't fail if user has no friends
    
    * styling fix for suggestions
    
    * deprecate makePlans (delete subsequently)
    
    * describe Detail recipe to avoid anonymous message
    
    * remove dead code
    
    * ws changes
    
    * required specialized font style
    
    * logging tweaks
    
    * Fix recipe description (#1428)
    
    * Disallow lowerCase names on recipes (#1432)
    
    * fix handle's isResolved method and type var description (#1430)
    
    * fix handle.isResolved method and add test
    
    * Use handle resolved type variable in description (instead of current [~undefined])
    
    * particle can verb -> &verb (#1433)
    
    * Remove some dead/unused code (#1434)
    
    None of our current particles use `setBusy` and it's probably better for
    this tracking to be the responsibility of the inner-pec. If a particle
    is able to defer execution the PEC should be aware that it is happening.
    
    * A tiny recipe name fix (#1437)
    
    * Set stats background to green in Words leaderboard. (#1438)
    
    To differentiate from the regular social feed.
    
    * Fix reentry of Arc.idle by caching an existing await-completion promise. (#1424)
    
    * invert flag: use `serial` url param to enable runtime arc serialization
