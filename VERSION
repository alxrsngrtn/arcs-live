    Type defs for src/platform. (#2822)
    
    Type defs for src/platform.
    
    This was achieved through a a combination of:
    * Converting from .js to .ts files
    * Adding .d.ts files
    
    The additional typing produced some new type errors in our code, which I
    had to fix/silence.
