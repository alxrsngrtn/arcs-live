    Muxer: map/build other views and connections per-item. (#1107)
    
    When muxing on a per-item basis the other-views/connections can vary
    with each item. This patch is just an incremental step toward dealing
    with this gracefully, and leaves a couple of TODOs.
    
    A social recipe that makes demonstrative use of these muxer changes to
    follow shortly.
