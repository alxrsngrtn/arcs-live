    Runtime store option (#1698)
    
    * make `useStorage` param-configurable
    
    * wait for `inflate`
    
    * actually record `storageProviderFactory`
    
    * restore empty arrays that have been evacipated by Firebase
    
    * remove undefined values from object-graph as required by Firebase
    
    * plumb config into cloud-handles so it can disable itself when using runtime-storage
    
    * support storageKey in FbStore, use `in-memory` for arcmetadata store
