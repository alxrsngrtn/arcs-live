    Preserves directory structure in arc_manifest_bundle (#3894)
    
    Updated arc_manifest_bundle build rule to be a proper rule instead of a
    macro. This allows us to use more advanced bazel functions to
    reconstruct the expected directory structure for Android assets folders.
    
    Also removed the generate_root_manifest.sh script, since it's no longer
    needed.
    
    Added a manifest bundle as an example to the javaharness. I'll replace
    it soon with the actual manifests needed by javaharness.
    
    For #3819
