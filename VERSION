    Add tests that make sure new handles are working after reload: (#3539)
    
    - Created handle test for JS and WASM particles
    - Made the NoOpStorageProxy also receives an id (since handle id is
    taken from the storage and sometimes it's still called and parsed even
    after reload)
    - Fixed some typo in NoOpStorageProxy
