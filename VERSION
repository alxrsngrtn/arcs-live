    Adds IArcsService.registerRemotePec() and RemotePec class. (#3587)
    
    This is some basic functionality for hooking a remote pec up to the main
    pec. In theory messages should be sendable to and from the remote pec,
    although I haven't tested this yet.
    
    Also rejiggered the ArcsServiceBridge async code quite a lot. It still
    looks overly complicated to me, I think there's a better way of doing
    it.
    
    There's a lot of TODOs scattered around :-(
