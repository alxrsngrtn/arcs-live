    Moves the ID-creating code out of Id and into a new class: IdGenerator (#2839)
    
    * Created a new IdGenerator class, and uses it when creating new IDs.
    
    * Hook up the IdGenerator
    
    * Fixed failing unit tests
    
    * Delete fake-random.ts, it's not needed
    
    * Revert random.ts
    
    * Added unit tests for Id and IdGenerator
    
    * Fixed shell
