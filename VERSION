    Added lint check for imports missing the .js extension (#3654)
    
    * Added lint check for imports missing the .js extension
    
    Also fixed all the existing imports that were missing a .js extension.
    
    These dodgy imports work fine most of the time, but cause issues with
    things like wdio tests for some reason. Now we have a lint check, no one
    can ever forget to do this ever again...
    
    There were a couple of package imports that confused the linter and
    needed to manually disable the lint check (e.g. import
    'firebase/storage')
    
    * Revert server/ and exclude from linting.
