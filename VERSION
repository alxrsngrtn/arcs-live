    The Raulnarok PR of 2018 (#2389)
    
    * Move non-shell source under src and build into build, allowing multiple
    directories to contain .ts files.
    Adds linking many files into build tree so imports work.
    Adds the file tools/reducethislist listing all the files that get linked.
    Much more refactoring will be needed to remove the need for linking, so this is
    just a start.
    
    * Merge commit after merging ToT into the enormous Raulnarok PR.
    
    * fixing accidental include of package.json and package-lock.json
    
    * Fixed a few imports not caught except on Travis
    
    * Fixing a few more missed imports found only by Travis
    
    * Fixing a few things from Mick's review
    
    * One more tweak. Imports. It's imports all the way down.
