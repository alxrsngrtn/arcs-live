    sigh: include wasm in build/test steps when emsdk is installed (#3526)
    
    * sigh: include wasm in build/test steps when emsdk is installed
    
    Running 'build' or 'test' without emsdk installed will now skip the wasm-related bits.
    The 'wasm' command always fails if emsdk isn't found.
    The '--install' flag still works in all cases.
    
    * Fix lint error
