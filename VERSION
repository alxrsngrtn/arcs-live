    Create CrdtEntityDescriptor, FieldValueInterpreter, etc. (#3811)
    
    These classes will be used by `CrdtEntity` (still a stub) to support entity definitions.
    
    A rough sketch for how to use the field value interpreters with CrdtEntity is in the kdoc for CrdtEntity. It's very rough, however.
