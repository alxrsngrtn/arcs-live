    Make StorageStub extend UnifiedStore, and use in Manifest parsing (#3679)
    
    * Make StorageStub extend UnifiedStore, and use in Manifest parsing
    
    Also added a new hacky method to cast from UnifiedStore to StorageStub.
    This will make it easier to track down all the places we need to update
    to handle the new storage api.
