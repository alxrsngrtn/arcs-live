    Wraps webpack in bazel rules for javaharness (#3738)
    
    This greatly simplifies the javaharness workflow. Instead of having to
    remember to webpack the various things (runtime, pipes-shell), bazel
    will detect for you when sources change and will run the various webpack
    scripts.
    
    `./tools/sigh webpack` is given its own BUILD target in
    `//tools:sigh_webpack`, and pipes-shell's `deploy.sh` script is given a
    target in `//shells/pipes-shell:pipes_shell_web`.
    
    Instructions for building javaharness have been updated, and the
    unnecessary build.sh script and various symlinks removed.
