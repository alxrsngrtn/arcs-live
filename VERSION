    Comvert recipe subdirectory to typescript (#2111)
    
    Also removed 2 typescript lint rules:
    
    no-angle-bracket-type-assertion:
    This lint rule is only relevant if the project uses .tsx, which we don't. `<string>foo` is closer to other language casts than `foo as string`, so it's worth allowing this syntax.
    
    no-conditional-assignment:
    conditional assignment is used pretty heavily in recipe comparators and they're a lot more readable as a result. I think the benefit of keeping this technique outweighs the potential costs of accidentally performing an assignment in a conditional expression.
