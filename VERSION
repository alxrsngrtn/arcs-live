    Added 'check foo is from handle bar' syntax (#3198)
    
    * Added 'check foo is from handle bar' syntax
    
    Updated the Check class to support having different types of conditions
    (HasTag, IsFromHandle). They are all implicitly OR'd together.
    
    The handle checks are not actually verified by the analyser yet. Follow
    up PR for that.
    
    * Typo
