    [Shells] simplify env: affordances for importing modules directly (#2630)
    
    * add missing platform-resolution for various modules
    
    * support for building web-loadable firebase and pouch
    
    * we require path imports
    
    * A `shells` rebuild with superior cross-platform support
    
    * for worker.js build, make webpack use the node version of sourcemapped-stacktrace
    
    * encapsulate details of DOM modality SlotComposer
    
    * cleanup
    
    * port in material for web-shell
    
    * promote yms to shells
    
    * use ram-cache for particle code
    
    * update build scripts for shells/lib changes
    
    * clean up
    
    * remove vestiges
    
    * restore tests and some unported shells, remove some dead code
    
    * wip
    
    * standardize webpack.configs
    
    * disable but capture 'headless particle' experiment
    
    * disable problematic caching experiment
    
    * fix particle impl caching by plumbing a BLOB through the PEC
    
    * support caching `worker.js` via Blob URL
    
    * remove caching work for other PR
    
    * update planner-shell
    
    * remove dead code
    
    * fix paths
