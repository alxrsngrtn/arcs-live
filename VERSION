    Change location of generated root manifest (#3967)
    
    * Change location of generated root manifest
    
    Root manifest now gets bundled to the same relative path. Extension has
    also changed to be `<name>.root.arcs` so that it's easier to build regex
    expressions for.
    
    So now the arcs_manifest_bundle build rule at
    `//javaharness/java/android/arcs/demo:demo_manifest_bundle` generates a
    root manifest at
    `bazel-bin/javaharness/java/android/arcs/demo/demo_manifest_bundle.root.arcs`
    which gets bundled into the android assets folder at `file://android_asset/arcs/javaharness/java/android/arcs/demo/demo_manifest_bundle.root.arcs`
