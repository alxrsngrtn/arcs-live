    StoreInterface, Store, ...., and.. DirectStore! (#3918)
    
    This PR implements everything required to get `DirectStore` up and running.
    
    I still would like to port more of the tests over from TypeScript (like sequence tests, for example), but I think this is a decent landmark before the PR becomes too huge.
