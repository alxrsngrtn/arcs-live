# emsdk-npm

Proof of concept npm-module wrapper for [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/)'s [emsdk](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk).

## What it does

Downloads emscripten SDK binaries into the local node_modules directory and makes emscripten tools easy to call from within your parent npm module's build scripts, without disturbing the user's global emscripten configuration.

## Usage

```sh
npm install --save-dev emsdk-npm
npx emsdk-checkout
npx emsdk install latest
npx emsdk activate latest
npx emsdk-run emcc test.c -o test.html
```

You can choose a specific release of emscripten to install by changing the `emsdk` parameters from "`latest`".

## How it works

With the `emsdk-checkout` command, emsdk is checked out via git into the module's subdirectory. The `emsdk` command is then callable , which allows installing and configuring a specific emscripten binary distribution.

The various tools like `emcc` and `em++` are then available through the `emsdk-run` command (they will not work until the '`activate`' step is done).

Note that emsdk's binary releases may not be available for all platforms, and sometimes release at different times.

Note that emsdk is used in "embedded" mode where it does not alter the user's global `~/.emscripten`, so different projects may install and use different versions of emscripten.

## Future plans

* add JS interfaces to use via Grunt etc
* add helper to auto-install an emscripten version based on parent's `package.json`
* if this is good for folks, move repo to `emscripten-core` and use a more official-sounding package name
